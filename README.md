## How to Use

### 1. Get the track list

Use the provided browser JS script on the Suno AI song list page to generate a `list.txt` file of all available tracks:

1. Open your browser console (F12) on [suno.com](https://suno.com/).
2. Paste and run the `js` snippet from this repo (`collect_suno_tracks.js`).
3. After script finishes, it will automatically download a `list.txt`.

### 2. Download all tracks

1. Place `list.txt` in the same folder as `suno_downloader.py`.
2. Run:

pip install -r requirements.txt
python suno_downloader.py

*(You need `Python 3.8+` and ffmpeg for full tag support)*

### 3. Find your ready tracks in the `downloads` folder.
